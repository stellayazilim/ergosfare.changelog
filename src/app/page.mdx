## v0.2.0e  {{ date: '2025-9-22' }}



### <SparkleIcon />  Snapshot & Checkpointing
* Introduced `PipelineCheckpoint` to track `Message`, `Result`, and `Success` for partial or full pipeline snapshotting.
* Pre- and post-interceptors updated to support snapshot-aware execution.
* Streaming and synchronous handlers can skip already completed checkpoints.
* Provides scoped caching within handlers; allows optional manual persistence by consumers.


```csharp
class JoinUserToRoleCommandHandler(
    IUserRepository userRepository
    IRoleRepository roleRepository,
    ISnapshotService snapshotService
    ) : ICommandHandler<JoinUserToRoleCommand> 
{

    async Task HandleAsync(
        JoinUserToRoleCommand command, 
        IExecutionContext context ) 
    {
        // snapshot database call
        // if this handler fails at other than this block
        // result from this snapshot persisted, and this block skipped
        var role = await snapshotService.Snapshot(
            "snapshot-role-exist", new Snapshot<RoleEntity>(() => 
        {
            return await roleRepository
                .GetRoleByNameAsync(command.Role.Name, context.CancellationToken)        
        })); 
        
        comamand.User.AddRole(role)
        
        
        await userRepository
                .UpdateUserAsync(command.User, context.CancellationToken); 
       
    } 
}
```

### <SparkleIcon />  Retry Mechanism

* Added `ErgosfareExecutionContext.RetryCount` to track retry attempts.
* `Retry()` publishes `PipelineRetrySignal` and throws `ExecutionRetryRequestedException`.
* `MessageMediator` refactored to catch retry requests and re-mediate with preserved context.
* MediateOptions support retry limits via `Retry` property.
### <SparkleIcon />  Streaming Mediation Improvements

* `SingleStreamHandlerMediationStrategy` fixed to ensure **pre-interceptors execute before the main handler**.
* Partial snapshotting after streaming completes successfully.

### <SparkleIcon />  Internal Changes

* Added `ExecutionRetryRequestedException` class.
* Added internal setters for `PipelineCheckpoint.Message` and `Result`.
* All mediation strategies refactored for snapshot support.
* Pre- and post-invokers refactored for snapshot compatibility.

### <SparkleIcon />  Fixes & Minor Adjustments

* Streaming strategy bug fixed: pre-interceptors now run correctly before streaming handler execution.

### <SparkleIcon />  Notes

* This will be the last **major/minor premature release** (`0.2.0e`).
* Only **patch releases** will follow in this branch.
* The next full release will be **stable v1.0.0**.
* Consumers can leverage checkpoints for caching or manual persistence in fire-and-forget pipelines.

### <SparkleIcon /> Breaking Changes
- `IExecutionContext` and `AmbientExecutionContext` are now under `Ergosfare.Core.Abstractions` namespace.  
Update any using statements and references in dependent projects.

### <SparkleIcon /> Changed
- Dropped `Ergosfare.Context` package.
- `Stella.Ergosfare.Context` package is no longer distributed.
- Moved `IExecutionContext` and `AmbientExecutionContext` to `Core.Abstractions.Context`.
- All execution context exceptions moved to `Ergosfare.Core.Abstractions/Exceptions`.
- Updated namespaces across the codebase to reflect context package removal.

- CI workflows updated to skip building and distributing `Ergosfare.Context` package.

### <SparkleIcon /> Notes
- This refactor is a internal chore to enable pipeline snapshot support.
---

## v0.1.2e - {{ date: '2025-09-20' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> **Added ambient data methods to `IExecutionContext`**

* `Set(string key, object item)` – Sets ambient data to share across the pipeline.
* `T Get<T>(string key)` – Retrieves ambient data by key.
* `bool Has(string key)` – Checks if a specific ambient data item exists.
* `bool TryGet<T>(string key, out T item)` – Attempts to retrieve ambient data; returns `true` if the item exists.

> **Note:** These methods are now part of the `IExecutionContext` API, allowing handlers and interceptors to store and access pipeline-level data.

---

## v0.1.1e - {{ date: '2025-09-19' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> **Added Ergosfare.Test.Fixtures**

Includes various useful tools, helpers and stubs for test authors, mainly for Ergosfare internals and Plugin developers

*  Final interceptors now run at the end of the pipeline (in `finally`), enabling cleanup and logging scenarios.
*  Support for nullable message results and exceptions passed into final interceptors.

### <SparkleIcon /> Pre- & Post-Interceptors

* **Pre-Interceptors**:

  *  Added support for both direct and indirect pre-interceptors.
  *  Can mutate messages and return a new one.
  *  Emit detailed events (`BeginPreIntercepting`, `FinishPreInterceptorInvocation`, etc.).

  *  Pre: `BeginPreInterceptingEvent`, `FinishPreInterceptorInvocationEvent`, …
  *  Post: `BeginPostInterceptingEvent`, `FinishPostInterceptorInvocationEvent`, …
  *  Exception: `BeginExceptionInterceptingEvent`, `FinishExceptionInterceptorInvocationEvent`
  *  Final: `BeginFinalInterceptingEvent`, `FinishFinalInterceptorInvocationEvent`
*  Events carry metadata (interceptor type, exception, total count).
*  Unified equality comparison for better test coverage.

### <SparkleIcon /> Result Adapter

*  Added `IResultAdapter` and `IResultAdapterService`:

  *  Detect exceptions inside result objects (e.g., `ErrorOr`).

## v0.0.14e – Event Hub Refines & Proxy Event System - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}
### <SparkleIcon /> New Features
* Generic Event Hub (EventHub): Supports strongly-typed events using `HubEvent` base class, with strong and weak subscriptions.
* Proxy Events (`ProxyEvent<T>`)  
Subscribe to predefined events using += and unsubscribe using -= syntax for cleaner code.
* Predefined Event: `PreInterceptorBeingInvokeEvent` added as a foundational example for interceptors and handlers.
* Custom Events: Subscribe, publish, and unsubscribe custom HubEvent types independently of predefined proxies.
* Value Object Base for Events:
HubEvent includes equality operators (`==`, `!=`) and value-based `Equals` / `GetHashCode` for future-proof event comparisons.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements
* Thread-safe subscriptions using ConcurrentDictionary and locking.
* Automatic cleanup of dead weak subscriptions during event publishing.

### <SparkleIcon /> Removals
* `ISubscription` and `IHubEvent` interfaces have been removed.
* Replace `ISubscription` with `ISubscription<TEvent>`
* Replace `IHubEvent` with the abstract `HubEvent` class

### <SparkleIcon /> Testing - Unit tests enhanced to cover:
* Strong/weak subscription invoke behavior
* Proxy `+=` / `-=` operators
* Subscription matching and unsubscription
* Base HubEvent equality and hash code computation

### <SparkleIcon /> Keynotes
* This release lays the foundation for next-generation plug-ins and modules, allowing n-party decoupled event-driven integrations.

* Users can create their own events implementing HubEvent for custom plugin scenarios.

## v0.0.13e - Republish of v0.0.12e - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}
- no changes

---

## v0.0.12e - EventHub - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> **New Features**

* **Centralized EventHub**: A thread-safe, global hub for Pre, Post, Handler, and Exception stage events.
* **Weak and Strong Subscriptions**: Subscribers can be registered as strong or weak references.

  * `IsAlive` property allows automatic cleanup of dead weak references.
  * Subscriptions implement `IDisposable`.
* **DI Integration**: EventHub now resolves via DI as a singleton using `EventHubAccessor`.
* **Thread-safe Publishing**: Publishing events is safe across multiple threads, with automatic cleanup of dead weak subscriptions.
* **Extensible Plugin Support**: Modules can subscribe to events without modifying core components.

####  **Keynote**

- This EventHub forms the foundation for future plugins and modules that do not need to be directly coupled with main modules.

- It enables developers to write their own n-party plugins, extending the system safely and independently.

#### **Side Note:**

* This EventHub system is **separate from the message mediation events** (pre/post/interceptor) used in command, query, and event pipelines.
* It provides a **general-purpose, centralized event mechanism** for modules and plugins to subscribe to runtime events without coupling to the core pipeline.
