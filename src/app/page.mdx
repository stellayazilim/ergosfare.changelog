## v0.1.0e – First minor release - {{ date: '2025-09-18' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> Final Interceptors

* ⚡ Introduced new interfaces:

  * ⚡ `IFinalInterceptor`, `IAsyncFinalInterceptor<TMessage, TResult>` for generic/non-generic messages.
  * ⚡ `ICommandFinalInterceptor`, `IQueryFinalInterceptor`, `IEventFinalInterceptor` for higher-level modules.
* ⚡ Final interceptors now run at the end of the pipeline (in `finally`), enabling cleanup and logging scenarios.
* ⚡ Support for nullable message results and exceptions passed into final interceptors.

### <SparkleIcon /> Pre- & Post-Interceptors

* **Pre-Interceptors**:

  * ⚡ Added support for both direct and indirect pre-interceptors.
  * ⚡ Can mutate messages and return a new one.
  * ⚡ Emit detailed events (`BeginPreIntercepting`, `FinishPreInterceptorInvocation`, etc.).

* ⚡ **Post-Interceptors**:

  * ⚡ Added support for both direct and indirect post-interceptors.
  * ⚡ Can mutate results before returning to the caller.
  * ⚡ Integrated `IResultAdapterService` to detect embedded exceptions in results.
  * ⚡ Emit events for normal execution and exception-like results (`FinishPostInterceptingWithException`).

### <SparkleIcon /> Exception Interceptors

* ⚡ Support for direct and indirect exception interceptors.
* ⚡ Emit begin/finish events for each interceptor.
* ⚡ Full support for nullable `messageResult`.
* ⚡ Rethrows exceptions if no interceptors are registered.

### <SparkleIcon /> Unified Pipeline Events

* ⚡ Refactored **EventHub → SignalHub**, and renamed `HubEvent → Signal` for clarity.
* ⚡ Introduced `PipelineEvent` base class (with `Message` and nullable `Result`).
* ⚡ Standardized event naming:

  * ⚡ Pre: `BeginPreInterceptingEvent`, `FinishPreInterceptorInvocationEvent`, …
  * ⚡ Post: `BeginPostInterceptingEvent`, `FinishPostInterceptorInvocationEvent`, …
  * ⚡ Exception: `BeginExceptionInterceptingEvent`, `FinishExceptionInterceptorInvocationEvent`
  * ⚡ Final: `BeginFinalInterceptingEvent`, `FinishFinalInterceptorInvocationEvent`
* ⚡ Events carry metadata (interceptor type, exception, total count).
* ⚡ Unified equality comparison for better test coverage.

### <SparkleIcon /> Result Adapter

* ⚡ Added `IResultAdapter` and `IResultAdapterService`:

  * ⚡ Detect exceptions inside result objects (e.g., `ErrorOr`).
  * ⚡ Allow exception interceptors to run without throwing original result types.
* ⚡ Integrated with post-interceptors and mediators for consistent handling.

### <SparkleIcon /> Mediators

* ⚡ `QueryMediator` and `EventMediator` updated to raise pipeline events.
* ⚡ Integrated `IResultAdapterService` into mediation strategies (`SingleAsyncHandlerMediationStrategy`, `AsyncBroadcastMediationStrategy`).
* ⚡ Improved async flow and nullability handling.

### <SparkleIcon /> Execution Strategies & Handler Invokers

* ⚡ Refactored pipeline execution strategies with final interceptor support.
* ⚡ Introduced **Handler Invokers**:

  * ⚡ Type-safe replacement for `MessageDependencyExtensions`.
  * ⚡ Unified mechanism for invoking handlers and interceptors.
  * ⚡ Integrated seamlessly with signals.

### <SparkleIcon /> Centralized Test Fixtures

* ⚡ Added new `Ergosfare.Test.Fixtures` assembly.
* ⚡ Common fixtures consolidated for reuse across test classes.
* ⚡ Introduced categorized stubs and stub factories to reduce inline stubs.
* ⚡ Improved maintainability, readability, and pluggability of test suite.
* ⚡ Achieved **95%+ coverage** with fixture-based test design.


### <SparkleIcon /> Fixes & Refactors

* ⚡ Cleaned up pipeline flow with consistent async/await handling.
* ⚡ Removed `MessageDependencyExtensions` in favor of handler invokers.
* ⚡ Unified naming across signals and interceptors.
* ⚡ Simplified exception interception without reflection/dynamic.


### <SparkleIcon /> Benefits

* ⚡ Final interceptors enable safe cleanup and logging.
* ⚡ Pre- and post-interceptors can mutate messages and results consistently.
* ⚡ Exception handling is safer, with result-based error detection via adapters.
* ⚡ Unified event/signal system improves observability and debugging.
* ⚡ Stronger modularity for command, query, and event pipelines.
* ⚡ Centralized, reusable test infrastructure.
* ⚡ Easier to maintain, extend, and test pipelines.

### <SparkleIcon /> Tests

* ⚡ Fixture-based tests for:

  * ⚡ `ErrorOr` adapter support.
  * ⚡ Exception interception (direct/indirect).
  * ⚡ Post-interceptor result exceptions.
* ⚡ Updated tests for signal structure, handler invokers, and fixtures.
* ⚡ Achieved consistent **95%+ coverage**.

## v0.0.14e – Event Hub Refines & Proxy Event System - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}
### <SparkleIcon /> New Features
* Generic Event Hub (EventHub): Supports strongly-typed events using `HubEvent` base class, with strong and weak subscriptions.
* Proxy Events (`ProxyEvent<T>`)  
Subscribe to predefined events using += and unsubscribe using -= syntax for cleaner code.
* Predefined Event: `PreInterceptorBeingInvokeEvent` added as a foundational example for interceptors and handlers.
* Custom Events: Subscribe, publish, and unsubscribe custom HubEvent types independently of predefined proxies.
* Value Object Base for Events:
HubEvent includes equality operators (`==`, `!=`) and value-based `Equals` / `GetHashCode` for future-proof event comparisons.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements
* Thread-safe subscriptions using ConcurrentDictionary and locking.
* Automatic cleanup of dead weak subscriptions during event publishing.

### <SparkleIcon /> Removals
* `ISubscription` and `IHubEvent` interfaces have been removed.
* Replace `ISubscription` with `ISubscription<TEvent>`
* Replace `IHubEvent` with the abstract `HubEvent` class

### <SparkleIcon /> Testing - Unit tests enhanced to cover:
* Strong/weak subscription invoke behavior
* Proxy `+=` / `-=` operators
* Subscription matching and unsubscription
* Base HubEvent equality and hash code computation

### <SparkleIcon /> Keynotes
* This release lays the foundation for next-generation plug-ins and modules, allowing n-party decoupled event-driven integrations.

* Users can create their own events implementing HubEvent for custom plugin scenarios.

## v0.0.13e - Republish of v0.0.12e - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}
- no changes

---

## v0.0.12e - EventHub - {{ date: '2025-09-03' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> **New Features**

* **Centralized EventHub**: A thread-safe, global hub for Pre, Post, Handler, and Exception stage events.
* **Weak and Strong Subscriptions**: Subscribers can be registered as strong or weak references.

  * `IsAlive` property allows automatic cleanup of dead weak references.
  * Subscriptions implement `IDisposable`.
* **DI Integration**: EventHub now resolves via DI as a singleton using `EventHubAccessor`.
* **Thread-safe Publishing**: Publishing events is safe across multiple threads, with automatic cleanup of dead weak subscriptions.
* **Extensible Plugin Support**: Modules can subscribe to events without modifying core components.

####  **Keynote**

- This EventHub forms the foundation for future plugins and modules that do not need to be directly coupled with main modules.

- It enables developers to write their own n-party plugins, extending the system safely and independently.

#### **Side Note:**

* This EventHub system is **separate from the message mediation events** (pre/post/interceptor) used in command, query, and event pipelines.
* It provides a **general-purpose, centralized event mechanism** for modules and plugins to subscribe to runtime events without coupling to the core pipeline.

- Updated unit tests to use context-based cancellation.
- Coverage badge regenerated to reflect new code changes.
