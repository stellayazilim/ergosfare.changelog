## v2.4.0 – '2026-09-14'

### Compiled selection and generated execution

Promote the completed preview changes since v2.3.1. This stable release includes breaking
public API changes announced through the v2.3.1 deprecations. Stream input, adapters and
plugins retain their experimental warning markers.

* Unify command, query, event and stream execution around generated executable plans with
  fixed composition metadata and hardcoded participant/adapter calls. Remove legacy roots,
  parallel single-handler tables, runtime pipeline construction and reflective fallbacks.
* `AddGenerated()` / `AddGenerated(pattern)` and explicit `Register<T>()` select the
  compiler-visible participant pool. Selection does not enable runtime discovery or later
  dynamic participant registration. Unselected types produce no executable plans.
* Keep application selections in referenced assemblies and generate executable plans in
  the composition root. Referenced libraries can export selections with
  `ErgosfareGeneratePlans=false`; endpoint calls are checked against those selections.
* Preserve closed generic message identities and their groups. Open generic selections
  include visible compatible constructions; unseen runtime constructions have no plans.
* Validate result adapters at compile time and embed their calls in plans. Adapters are
  helpers, not DI services. Preserve the polymorphic handler resolution priority ladder.

### Public dispatch surface and diagnostics

* Grouped dispatch accepts `GroupSet`, including collection expressions, implicit strings
  and `GroupSet.Of()`. Remove the deprecated string/array/enumerable overload families.
* Module mediators use their shared internal engine and dispatch provider through DI;
  remove unused facade layers and obsolete manual construction surfaces.
* Missing handlers for compile-time-known messages/groups, including events, produce
  compilation diagnostics. Dynamic groups use generated filtering plans and fail at
  runtime when no main handler matches; they cannot discover additional participants.
* Experimental surfaces emit `ERGOEXP001–003` warnings rather than unconditional errors.
  Preview deprecation can precede removal in the corresponding stable minor release.

### Experimental streams and multipart upload

* Add fluent `CommandStream<TChunk, TSelf>` and `QueryStream<TChunk, TSelf>` inputs, immediate
  bounded `Pipe`, reusable stream/item converters, and growable `IBufferWriter<T>` staging
  with asynchronous flush/backpressure. Metadata belongs to the message itself.
* Root stream inputs are asynchronously disposable. Dispatch/disposal releases producers;
  output-stream failures preserve the original error and reach consumers/finals. Early
  output disposal uses `StreamOutputDisposedException`. Explicit context abort still skips
  finals; output-stream failures bypass exception interceptors.
* Add a multipart upload recipe and runnable E2E browser form: raw body → pre validation
  and first-chunk context handoff → incremental file handler → final cleanup. Preserve
  client-declared MIME in JSON metadata and prove byte identity with SHA-256 and WAV/UTF-8
  samples. Include cancellation, missing/empty file and malformed-body tests.
* Add E2E WebSocket input/duplex and SSE examples, root/local Taskfile commands and organized
  helper scripts. Refresh the generated API reference and documentation for both lines.


## v2.3.1 – '2026-09-14'

### Deprecation notice

* Marked the public APIs already removed from preview as obsolete on the stable line:
  mediation settings and their dispatch overloads, mediator extension classes, direct
  mediator constructors, two-parameter pre-interceptors, `ForceMemoizedHandlers`, and
  `AsyncBroadcastMediationStrategy<TMessage>`. Their existing behavior remains available
  in this patch; they are scheduled for removal in the next stable minor release.
* Obsolete messages describe the migration path: module mediator methods, `GroupSet`,
  DI resolution, single-message pre-interceptors, and source-generated execution plans.
* Experimental result-adapter APIs now emit warnings with the existing `ERGOEXP001`
  diagnostic ID instead of default compilation errors. Existing suppressions still work;
  projects treating warnings as errors retain control of their diagnostic policy.
* Updated the English and Turkish compatibility policy: preview deprecation or removal
  can precede removal in the corresponding stable minor without a separate stable
  deprecation release. No API is removed by this patch.

## v2.3.0 – '2026-08-12'

Stable release. The theme: **the pipeline becomes a compiled artifact.** The preview cycle
from v2.2.0-preview through v2.9.0-preview moved Ergosfare from a source-assisted runtime
registry to a closed, source-generated dispatch model. The generator's frozen composition
table is now the authority for handler and interceptor relationships; module registration
selects which discovered constructs a container runs, and dispatch executes that selection
without reflective scanning or runtime pipeline mutation.

This release also finishes the public dispatch contract: concrete execution contexts,
explicit nested scopes, typed exception interception, predictable abort semantics,
covariant main-handler resolution, canonical resultless pipelines and one failure model for
missing handlers. The complete preview history is condensed here into the stable contract.

### Frozen composition replaces the runtime registry

* `FrozenCompositionCatalog` replaces `IMessageRegistry` end to end. The generator emits
  one immutable composition per message: direct and covariant handler rows plus the pre,
  post, exception and final interceptor stages in execution order.
* Registration is selection, not discovery. `RegisterGenerated()` and `Register<T>()`
  select constructs from the compiled table for one DI container; repeated and overlapping
  selections are harmless unions.
* Runtime mutation and reflective assembly scanning are gone. A dynamically loaded assembly
  cannot append a new message shape after compilation, and there is no registration window
  whose timing can change an already running application.
* Generated participant types preserve the constructor metadata required by Microsoft DI
  under trimming. The NativeAOT smoke covers command, query and event activation—including
  multi-subscriber broadcast and value-type messages—in a published native binary.

### Source-generated dispatch and NativeAOT

* Generated dispatch roots close executor and invoker generics over concrete message and
  result types at compile time. The hot path avoids registry scans, reflection,
  `MakeGenericType` and object-typed handler bridges.
* Single-handler command and query pipelines receive generated plans. Eligible transient
  handlers can also receive direct-construction factories, including provider-based
  factories for constructor dependencies, while runtime gates preserve the configured DI
  lifetime and user overrides.
* Interceptor-bearing pipelines receive generated staged plans: straight-line typed calls
  for pre, handler, post, exception and final stages. A composition mismatch gives up only
  the optimization and falls back to the general executor.
* The generator scans referenced assemblies, reports inaccessible constructs as diagnostics,
  respects nullable annotations in consumer compilations and can trim provably unreachable
  handlers at the composition root.

### A pinned pipeline contract

* A public-surface contract suite now runs the dispatch scenarios across the supported
  composition lanes on .NET 9, .NET 10 and .NET 11 — 194 scenarios on each. Its lane-map
  baseline records not only the result, but the dispatch path that produced it.
* `Abort()`, `Abort(reason)` and `Abort(reason, value)` stop the pipeline immediately and
  surface `ExecutionAbortedException` to the caller. Exception and final interceptors do
  not run after an abort; nested callers decide whether an inner abort ends the outer
  pipeline too.
* Resultless commands and events carry the single `Unit.Value` instance after successful
  execution. `null` retains the distinct meaning “no result was produced.”
* Main-handler resolution is a priority ladder over the direct and covariantly matched rows.
  A sole direct handler wins outright, however many covariant candidates exist; without one,
  a supertype handler serves the assignable message. Two claimants *at the same level* are a
  contest, counted before anything resolves, so the message runs neither and the caller gets
  `MultipleHandlerFoundException`. The generator reports the same condition as `ERGOSG010` at
  build time.
* New typed `...ExceptionInterceptorFor<TException>` contracts declare the exception type they
  accept and follow catch semantics, so the exception arrives typed and nothing has to
  remember to rethrow. They sit **beside** the untyped contracts, which are unchanged and stay
  the right shape for an interceptor handling several exception types or logging every
  failure. With either family, an exception is swallowed only when an interceptor that
  actually matched it returns a value; otherwise the original exception and stack leave the
  pipeline unchanged.
* Missing and filtered-out handlers consistently use `NoHandlerFoundException`, which now
  derives from `InvalidOperationException` and exposes `MessageType`. Event publication
  honors `ThrowIfNoHandlerFound` for every no-subscriber shape.
* A selected participant that the container cannot resolve fails before the first stage
  with `UnresolvableParticipantException`, naming both the message and participant.

### `ErgosfareContext` and nested dispatch

* The public sealed `ErgosfareContext` replaces `IExecutionContext`. Handler and
  interceptor contracts take the concrete type, eliminating an interface dispatch whose
  only implementation was internal.
* Its public constructor accepts optional items and cancellation, allowing callers to own
  a context for engine-level dispatch. Facade dispatches continue to rent contexts from the
  allocation-conscious pool.
* `ErgosfareContextScope` replaces `ExecutionContextScope`. `CreateScope()` is its only
  producer: a child starts with clean items, inherits cancellation and returns its pooled
  context on disposal. Disposing a default scope remains a no-op.
* Execution state stays explicit. There is no `AsyncLocal` context and no service provider
  exposed through the context.

### Modules, events and cross-cutting policies

* Commands, queries and events remain independent modules over the shared core. The event
  module is also the open lane for POCO messages: `IEventHandler<TEvent>` and
  `PublishAsync<TEvent>` accept any non-null event type and retain broadcast semantics.
* `AddCoreModule`, `CoreModule`, `CoreModuleBuilder` and `IModuleBuilder` are removed. Plain
  messages move to the event module; custom modules select from the frozen composition
  table and register their facade and services with DI.
* Cross-cutting interceptors join built-in module partitions by carrying their marker
  interfaces directly—for example an `IAsyncPreInterceptor<IMessage>` that also implements
  `ICommand`, `IQuery` and `IEvent`. Covariant rows apply it broadly and
  `[ExcludeFromPipeline]` provides blanket or group-specific opt-out.
* `GroupSet` provides a reusable canonical group filter, avoiding per-dispatch settings
  allocation while preserving grouped handler and interceptor selection.
* Discovery keys support exact and prefix-glob selection across the application and its
  references. `[ExcludeFromDiscovery]` remains the explicit exclusion boundary.

### Performance and DI semantics

* Mediator facades are transient, stateless wrappers over a shared dispatch engine. They
  capture the provider of the resolving scope without paying the scoped-service cache and
  lock cost on every request-shaped dispatch.
* Participant instances resolve from the dispatching scope, so singleton, scoped,
  transient and keyed registrations retain Microsoft DI semantics. The module default is
  transient; `ForceMemoizedHandlers()` remains available when process-wide reuse is the
  intended contract.
* Executors cache the frozen dependency shape, generated holders remove repeated composite
  lookups and pooled contexts avoid a per-dispatch context allocation. The `ValueTask`-first
  surface preserves synchronous completion through the public facades.
* On the v2.7.0-preview benchmark tree (.NET 9.0.11, Ryzen 7 7800X3D), a generated no-result
  command measured 19.9 ns / 24 B, a result query 24.0 ns / 24 B, a five-participant query
  120.2 ns / 96 B and a two-subscriber event 50.5 ns / 48 B. Request-shaped rows that
  create a DI scope and resolve a mediator remained ahead of the equivalent MediatR rows.

### Target frameworks

* Packages carry **`net11.0` beside `net10.0` and `net9.0`**. The addition buys no
  compatibility on its own — roll-forward already let a `net11.0` project bind
  `lib/net10.0/` — so what it carries is proof: the sources compile under the C# 15
  compiler, and the contract suite holds its lane map on .NET 11 on every run.
* **Nothing from .NET 11 or C# 15 is adopted**, and the reasons are worth recording. The
  runtime-side gains — JIT bounds-check elimination, GC work, NativeAOT's faster interface
  dispatch — need no target framework at all; a `net10.0` assembly already collects them
  running on .NET 11. The library additions have no call sites here. C# 15 union types
  store their payload in an `object?` field and box value types, which is the object-typed
  bridge the dispatch hot path was built to avoid, and the `closed` modifier applies to
  classes while the handler contracts are interfaces.
* **Runtime Async** is the one target-framework-gated win, deliberately deferred: it
  rewrites async codegen wholesale and needs the lane-map baseline re-validated against the
  abort semantics first. The target framework holds the slot; the feature waits.
* `LangVersion` stays `latest`, which now resolves to **C# 15 for the `net9.0` and
  `net10.0` compilations too**, since the language version follows the compiler rather than
  the target framework. Deliberate: one language version across all three, so a construct
  cannot compile on one target and fail on another.
* .NET 11 reaches GA on **2026-11-10**, the same day .NET 9 leaves support. Assets shipped
  for `net11.0` before that date are compiled against **preview reference packs** and want
  a re-pack against the GA reference pack once .NET 11 ships; the obligation is recorded in
  `.github/workflows/nuget_release.yml` rather than left to memory. Building the repository
  now requires the .NET 11 preview SDK — this affects contributors, not consumers, who need
  it only if they themselves target `net11.0`.

### Breaking changes and migration

* **Removed:** `IMessageRegistry` and descriptor APIs, `RegisterFromAssembly`,
  `RegisterDescriptors`, `MediateOptions`, message-resolve strategies, the low-level
  `IMessageMediator.Mediate` surface, `IExecutionContext`, `ExecutionContextScope`,
  `IPoolReturnable`, `AddCoreModule`, `CoreModule`, `CoreModuleBuilder` and
  `IModuleBuilder`.
* **Replace registry calls** with source-generated `RegisterGenerated()` selections or
  statically known `Register<T>()` selections. Runtime-computed participant and assembly
  registration is no longer supported.
* **Replace context types** with `ErgosfareContext` and create nested contexts only through
  `context.CreateScope()`.
* **Move plain messages** to `IEventHandler<T>` / `PublishAsync<T>`, and tag broad
  interceptors with the command, query and event marker interfaces they should join.
* **Audit abort callers:** abort now reaches the call site as `ExecutionAbortedException`
  and prevents all downstream stages, including final interceptors.
* **Audit contested handlers:** two main handlers on the same level — two direct, or two
  covariant with no direct one — now conflict instead of letting one win silently. A direct
  handler still beats covariant ones; that pairing is not a contest.
* The full solution, contract suite and NativeAOT smoke are green on the stable promotion
  commit with zero build warnings.

## v2.2.0 – '2026-08-10'

Stable release. Deprecates the reflection-based assembly-scanning surface: the
`RegisterFromAssembly` overloads on the four module builders, the `IModuleBuilder` seam
and `ResultAdapterBuilder`'s scan now carry `[Obsolete]` and warn at build time, one
release ahead of their removal. Compile-time discovery is the migration target —
`RegisterGenerated()` / `RegisterGenerated(pattern)` and `Register<T>()`, adapters via
`Register<TAdapter>()`. No API removals and no behavior changes in this release; the
builders' tests keep pinning the obsolete surface until the removal lands.

## v2.1.0 – '2026-08-07'

Stable maintenance release of the v2 line. Its preview carried repository and release-channel
chores only. The feature history that was previously repeated through the early preview
entries is consolidated into the v2.3.0 stable entry above.

## v2.0.0 – '2026-07-25'

First stable release of the v2 line. The theme: **all dispatch-shape work moves to compile time
or to a once-per-message-type plan** — registration is source-generated, dispatch generics
close at compile time, execution contexts are pooled, and the dispatch path carries no
reflection, no `MakeGenericType`, no registry scan and no `AsyncLocal`.

### Source-generated registration (`Stella.Ergosfare.SourceGenerator`)

* New incremental Roslyn generator discovers every Ergosfare construct in the compilation and emits `RegisterGenerated()` extensions on the module builders (plus a DI-agnostic `RegisterAll(IMessageRegistry)`) — drop-in replacements for `RegisterFromAssembly(...)`, with **pre-computed handler descriptors**: registration performs no reflection over handler types. Plain messages and open generics keep the runtime `Register(Type)` fallback; both paths are mutually idempotent, so generated and runtime registration can coexist.
* **Reference scanning:** the consuming project's generator also walks referenced assemblies — a library's handlers register through the app's generated code with zero registration code in the library. Internal types participate via `InternalsVisibleTo`; types generated code cannot name surface as **ERGOSG002** (marker types the runtime scan would have caught). Opt out per project with `<ErgosfareSourceGeneratorScanReferences>false</ErgosfareSourceGeneratorScanReferences>`. Assemblies named under the reserved `Stella.Ergosfare.*` prefix are skipped by default (their contract interfaces inherit the module markers); an app deliberately named under that prefix opts back in per-assembly with `<ErgosfareSourceGeneratorForceScanReferences>true</ErgosfareSourceGeneratorForceScanReferences>` — only assemblies that set it are scanned, so the library's own contracts are never registered.
* **Discovery keys:** `[DiscoveryKey("reporting.daily")]` gates a type out of default discovery until a registration call selects it — `RegisterGenerated()` takes untagged types, `RegisterGenerated("reporting.*")` cherry-picks by exact key or trailing-`*` prefix glob, and calls chain safely. `[assembly: DiscoveryKey]` tags a whole library; `[ExcludeFromDiscovery]` (type or assembly) removes a construct from discovery entirely. The reflection path (`RegisterFromAssembly`, now with a pattern overload) honors the same attributes.
* **Generated dispatch roots:** the generator emits compile-time generic closures (`GeneratedDispatchRoots.AddMessage<M>` / `AddResult<M, R>` / `AddStream<Q, R>`), letting the executor, event-broadcast and stream-invoker caches construct their pipelines **without `MakeGenericType`** — and giving Native AOT a static anchor for every instantiation, value-type messages included. The reflective path remains only as the fallback for open generics and runtime-only registrations.
* Diagnostics: `ERGOSG001` (inaccessible registrable type), `ERGOSG002` (invisible referenced type).

### Dispatch engine

* **Per-message-type pipeline executors.** Dispatch goes through a pipeline closed over the message's runtime type, built once per (message type, result type, group set) and cached process-wide; the facades resolve executors with a dictionary lookup. No per-call options object, no interface-erased strategy, no object-typed bridge — interface-erased dispatch throws `NotSupportedException` with guidance.
* **Independent sync/async contracts, typed end to end.** `IHandler` and the four interceptor roots are empty markers; typed synchronous and `ValueTask`-based asynchronous contracts are standalone hierarchies invoked exclusively through their typed members (generic invocation strategies, contravariant in message/result). All DIM bridges and object-typed root members are gone; synchronous typed interceptors actually work now (the old bridge crashed them with `InvalidCastException`).
* **`ValueTask`-first surface** across handlers, interceptors and facades; synchronously completing handlers allocate nothing.
* **Thread-safe registration.** Registration is serialized behind a gate with lock-free snapshot readers (immutable descriptor-array snapshots, copy-on-write stage arrays, version-stamped resolve caching — fixing registration races, mid-registration enumeration crashes, and a resolve-cache poisoning bug). Hot-path LINQ removed from event broadcast and pipeline-shape building.

### Execution context — scopes, pooling, nested dispatch

* **Nested dispatch as a first-class pattern:** `context.CreateScope()` returns a struct scope wrapping a clean, pooled child context — isolated items, inherited cancellation token. Facades accept the child (`SendAsync`/`QueryAsync`/`PublishAsync` overloads taking `IExecutionContext`; `MediateOptions.ExternalContext` for the options paths). An inner `Abort()` ends only the inner pipeline; parallel inner dispatches with separate scopes are safe.
* **Pooled execution contexts:** dispatches rent and return contexts through a `[ThreadStatic]`-first pool with a synchronous fast path (no async state machine when the pipeline completes synchronously). A context is valid only for the duration of its dispatch. Public-facade allocations drop **5.34 → 2.29 MB per 100k dispatches** with Gen0 pressure halved, at time parity.
* Context fixes: `Has`/`TryGet`/`Get` no longer allocate the items dictionary on an empty context; `Get` throws the documented `KeyNotFoundException`.

### Pipeline control

* **`[ExcludeFromPipeline]`** on a message type excludes covariantly matched interceptors — blanket or per group (`[ExcludeFromPipeline("logging")]`). Interceptors registered for the message type itself always run; main handlers are never affected.
* **Event broadcast delivers to covariantly matched handlers** (registered against a base type or interface of the event) — the event's own handlers first, then indirect ones. Opting out of broad delivery is a group concern.
* The two-parameter command/query post-/exception-interceptor contracts are now contravariant in their message parameter, matching the core contracts.
* The single-parameter pre-interceptor contracts (`ICommandPreInterceptor<TCommand>`, `IQueryPreInterceptor<TQuery>`, `IEventPreInterceptor<TEvent>`) now return the typed message (`ValueTask<TMessage>`) instead of `ValueTask<object>` — a pre-interceptor carries no result, so the message type is all there is to return. The non-generic contracts still return `object` (they intercept any message); the two-parameter variants still return the modified message type. `TMessage` is invariant because it is now returned.
* Fixed: the void-flavored `IEventPreInterceptor` default implementation returned `ValueTask.CompletedTask` as the pipeline's message-replacement value, crashing event pipelines running an event-wide pre-interceptor.

### Removed

* **`Stella.Ergosfare.Contracts` folded into Core.Abstractions** (`GroupAttribute`/`WeightAttribute` now in `Stella.Ergosfare.Core.Abstractions.Attributes`); the package is no longer produced.
* **`AmbientExecutionContext`** and `EnableAmbientExecutionContext()` (deprecated since v1.2.0): the context parameter is the only access path; no `AsyncLocal` remains on the dispatch path. `NoExecutionContextException` removed with it.
* The obsolete three-parameter `TModifiedResult` interceptor interfaces (deprecated in v1.4.0) — use the two-parameter typed variants.
* `IAsyncValueTaskHandler<TMessage, TResult>` (experimental) — `IAsyncHandler` itself now carries the `ValueTask` shape. The `[Experimental]` gate (`ERGOEXP`) stays in place for future APIs.
* Internal cleanups: `MainInvoker`, the `AbstractInvoker` layer, and the interceptor object roots.

### Benchmark (100k no-op dispatches, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, .NET 9, 2026-07-24)

| Scenario | Mean | Allocated |
|---|---:|---:|
| Ergosfare — typical usage (`SendAsync`, shared scope) | 6.87 ms | **2.29 MB** |
| MediatR — typical usage | 6.09 ms | 18.31 MB |
| Ergosfare — fresh DI scope per dispatch | 18.81 ms | 38.91 MB |
| MediatR — fresh DI scope per dispatch | 10.09 ms | 33.57 MB |

### Migration notes

* `using Stella.Ergosfare.Contracts.Attributes;` → `using Stella.Ergosfare.Core.Abstractions.Attributes;`; drop the `Stella.Ergosfare.Contracts` package reference.
* Handler/interceptor signatures: `Task`/`Task<T>` → `ValueTask`/`ValueTask<T>` (mechanical; `async` bodies need only the signature change).
* `AmbientExecutionContext.Current` → the `IExecutionContext` parameter your handler already receives.
* Prefer `RegisterGenerated()` (with the `Stella.Ergosfare.SourceGenerator` package) over `RegisterFromAssembly(...)`; the latter remains for runtime-loaded plugins.
* Do not hold an `IExecutionContext` reference beyond the dispatch it belongs to — contexts are pooled.

## v1.4.0 – '2026-07-22'

### Features & Improvements

#### Typed interceptors without the third type parameter

* The two-parameter typed interceptor interfaces — `ICommandExceptionInterceptor<TCommand, TResult>`, `ICommandPostInterceptor<TCommand, TResult>`, `IQueryExceptionInterceptor<TQuery, TResult>`, `IQueryPostInterceptor<TQuery, TResult>` — now declare the type-safe `HandleAsync` member returning the typed result directly.
* Their type parameters are deliberately **invariant** now: the pipeline invokes interceptors through the non-generic root interfaces, so interface variance bought nothing — while `in TResult` blocked typed returns, which was the only reason the three-parameter `TModifiedResult` variants existed.
* The three-parameter variants are marked `[Obsolete]` and will be removed in the next major version.
* Migration note: implementors of the previous marker-only two-parameter interfaces now implement the typed member (returning `Task<TResult>` / `Task<TResult?>`) instead of the base `Task<object>` member.

### CI

* Coverage and unit-test workflows run as a single job with both SDKs installed — the solution multi-targets net9.0/net10.0, so per-SDK matrix legs could not restore it, and the two parallel coverage jobs raced each other pushing the badges branch (the `is at … but expected …` non-fast-forward failure).
* The coverage badge is generated only on pushes to `main` (pull requests no longer overwrite the badge or push to the badges branch), and the badge action receives only its supported `coverage-file-name` input.

## v1.3.0 – '2026-07-22'

### Internal Surface Changes — Core / Core.Abstractions

These packages are public so the first-party modules (Commands, Queries, Events) can consume them across assembly boundaries; they are not a third-party plugin contract, so changes here are not considered breaking. Code that registers handlers/interceptors and dispatches through `ICommandMediator`/`IQueryMediator`/`IEventMediator` compiles and behaves unchanged.

* `IMessageDependencies` reshaped: ten lazy collections → six fixed `IReadOnlyList` stages. The four interceptor stages (pre/post/exception/final) merge direct and indirect registrations into a single list — direct entries first, then indirect, each segment ordered by weight and handler type name — matching the execution order the invokers previously implemented as two passes. Main handlers keep the direct/indirect split because single-handler validation applies to direct handlers only.
* `ILazyHandler`, `ILazyHandlerCollection`, `LazyHandler`, `LazyHandlerCollection`, and `ToLazyReadOnlyCollection` are removed. Their replacement is `IHandlerReference<THandler, TDescriptor>`: the descriptor, the pre-computed concrete `HandlerType`, and `Resolve(IServiceProvider)` which obtains the instance for the current dispatch.
* `IMessageMediationStrategy<TMessage, TResult>.Mediate` gained an `IServiceProvider` parameter: the mediator hands the dispatching scope's provider down the pipeline explicitly — resolution is the dispatcher's responsibility. The execution context stays a pure data carrier between handlers: it plays no part in handler resolution and deliberately exposes no service provider, so user-facing handler code gets no service-locator surface.
* `IMessageDependenciesFactory` is registered as a **singleton** (was scoped); its dependency graphs are provider-independent and cached process-wide. `IMessageMediator` stays scoped but is now a thin wrapper whose only per-scope job is carrying the scope's provider into the execution context.
* Implementation types in `Stella.Ergosfare.Core` that are not part of the public contract are now `internal`: the handler descriptor builders (`HandlerDescriptorBuilder`, `PreInterceptorDescriptionBuilder`, `PostHandlerDescriptorBuilder`, `ExceptionInterceptorDescriptorBuilder`, `FinalInterceptorDescriptorBuilder`), `HandlerDescriptorBuilderFactory`, and `MessageDependenciesFactory` (still consumable through the public `IMessageDependenciesFactory`). Default implementations of public abstractions — `ResultAdapterService`, `LruCacheStrategy` — remain public. First-party assemblies use `InternalsVisibleTo`; forks building custom modules can add their own grants.

### Features & Improvements

#### Provider-independent dependency graphs — scope-per-dispatch ~2.6x faster, ~2.7x less allocation

* The resolved pipeline of a message (ordered stages, closed generic handler types) is built once per message type and group set, and shared process-wide. A fresh DI scope no longer rebuilds factory state, per-scope caches, or lazy wrapper graphs — the per-scope cost is the scope itself plus two small mediator wrappers.
* Handler and interceptor instances resolve per invocation from the execution context's provider, so DI lifetimes are honored exactly: singleton → container-cached, scoped → one per scope, transient → one per dispatch. Fully singleton pipelines (and `ForceMemoizedHandlers()`) additionally cache instances inside their references, pinned to the root provider.
* Pipeline shapes pre-compute closed generic handler types: `MakeGenericType` runs once per closed message type instead of on every scope's first resolution. Closing is guarded by `IsGenericTypeDefinition`, so handlers registered against a constructed generic message resolve as-is (previously a latent `MakeGenericType` throw on first resolution).
* Interceptor invocation is a single indexed pass over the merged, pre-ordered array — the double direct/indirect passes and per-loop enumerator allocations are gone.
* Benchmark (100k dispatches/op, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, .NET 9, fresh scope per dispatch): 45.6 ms / 146.5 MB → **17.2 ms / 53.4 MB**; MediatR on the same shape: 10.3 ms / 33.6 MB.

### Notes

* Behavioral change: transient-registered handlers (the framework default) now resolve once per dispatch instead of being implicitly reused across dispatches within the same scope — i.e. a transient registration now behaves as declared, matching MediatR semantics. On dispatch-heavy single-scope loops this costs one handler instance per dispatch (raw mediator path: 3.05 → 6.1 MB per 100k dispatches — still well below MediatR's 18.3 MB on the same loop). To keep instance reuse, register those handlers as singletons (before `AddErgosfare`, so `TryAdd` respects it) or call `ForceMemoizedHandlers()`.
* Dispatching a message whose pipeline has no direct main handler now throws `InvalidOperationException` with an explicit "No handler is registered for …" message instead of a LINQ "Sequence contains no elements" error.

## v1.2.0 – '2026-07-22'

### Deprecations

#### `AmbientExecutionContext` (planned removal in the next major version)

* The entire `AmbientExecutionContext` API is now marked `[Obsolete]`: the execution context is passed to every handler and interceptor as a parameter, which is the supported way to access it.
* Ambient publication is now **opt-in and disabled by default**. Components that require constructor-injected `IExecutionContext` (the only feature that genuinely needs the ambient mechanism) must enable it during registration:

  ```csharp
  services.AddErgosfare(options =>
  {
      options.EnableAmbientExecutionContext(); // deprecated compatibility switch
      options.AddCoreModule(module => { /* ... */ });
  });
  ```

* When disabled (the default), no `AsyncLocal` write occurs on the dispatch path. Resolving `IExecutionContext` from DI without enabling the switch throws `NoExecutionContextException` with guidance.
* Migration: replace `AmbientExecutionContext.Current` usages with the `IExecutionContext` parameter your handler/interceptor already receives. The static API will be removed together with `EnableAmbientExecutionContext()` in the next major release.

### Features & Improvements

#### Dispatch hot-path overhaul (~5x faster, ~11x less allocation)

* Resolved message descriptors are cached per message `Type` in the resolve strategy; the previous full-registry LINQ scan per dispatch is gone.
* Zero-interceptor fast path: when a message has no pre/post/exception/final interceptors, the handler is invoked directly — no invoker objects or empty-collection async iterations are constructed.
* Resolved `MessageDependencies` are cached in `ConcurrentDictionary`s keyed by `Type` (plus a struct key for group filters); per-dispatch string-key construction, service-provider lookups, and LRU timestamp writes are eliminated.
* `CommandMediator`/`QueryMediator` reuse their stateless mediation strategies and no longer materialize default settings objects per call; mediators are now registered as singletons (`TryAdd`, so user overrides still apply).
* `MessageDescriptor` stage lists are allocated lazily, trimming startup allocations per registered message type.
* Benchmark (100k dispatches/op, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, .NET 9, ambient context disabled): raw mediator path 31.6 ms / 112.9 MB → 4.4 ms / 3.1 MB; public `SendAsync` path 5.3 ms / 9.2 MB; MediatR on the same benchmark: 6.1 ms / 18.3 MB.

#### Lifetime-aware handler resolution — scoped dependencies now supported (default on)

* Handler resolution now honors registered DI lifetimes. Messages whose handlers and interceptors are all **singleton-registered** keep the process-wide memoized fast path; everything else (the framework default is transient) is resolved from the **calling scope's provider** and cached per scope — so scoped constructor dependencies (`DbContext`, unit-of-work, current-user services) get one instance per scope, exactly like MediatR, and `IDisposable` handlers/dependencies are disposed with their scope.
* Previously (v1.1.0) handler instances were silently memoized process-wide: the first dispatch captured the first caller's scope — including its `DbContext` — and reused it for every subsequent dispatch, even after that scope was disposed. This was a latent correctness bug that did not surface as an exception (default `BuildServiceProvider()` does not validate scopes).
* Opting out: `ForceMemoizedHandlers()` on the registration builder restores the pre-v1.2 memoize-everything behavior for maximum dispatch throughput. Per-handler control needs no new API — register a handler as singleton (before `AddErgosfare`, so `TryAdd` respects it) to keep it on the fast path.
* Within a scope, resolution is memoized per message type, so apps dispatching several messages per request pay the per-dispatch resolution cost once per scope.
* Ordered, group-filtered pipeline shapes are cached process-wide (invalidated by the registry version); a fresh scope only materializes cheap lazy wrappers over the cached descriptor arrays.
* Cost (measured, fresh scope per dispatch — the per-request worst case): ~0.47 µs and ~1.55 KB per scope for a single-handler message, versus ~0.11 µs / ~0.35 KB for MediatR's equivalent shape; dispatches after the first within the same scope use the memoized fast path (~55-70 ns).

#### Runtime registration correctness

* `MessageRegistry` now tracks a monotonic `Version`, and dependency caches invalidate when the registry changes — runtime registrations (including handlers added to already-registered messages) become visible to subsequent dispatches. Previously the dependency cache was never invalidated.

### Bug Fixes

* `IAsyncPostInterceptor<TMessage, TResult>` default implementation now forwards the `IExecutionContext` parameter it receives instead of reading the ambient context.
* `SingleStreamHandlerMediationStrategy` no longer unconditionally overwrites the ambient context without restoring it; it re-publishes the context for stream enumeration only when ambient access is enabled.
* Final interceptor types (direct and indirect) are now registered with the DI container; previously `RegisterHandlersFromDescriptor` skipped them, so standalone final interceptors could not be resolved.

### API Changes

* `MediateOptions<TMessage, TResult>.Items` is now nullable and no longer allocates a default dictionary; the execution context creates its `Items` dictionary lazily on first access.
* `ILazyHandlerCollection<THandler, TDescriptor>` gained a `First()` default interface method (allocation-free in the built-in implementation).
* `ICommandMediator`, `IQueryMediator`, `IEventMediator`/`IPublisher`, `IMessageMediator`, and `IMessageDependenciesFactory` are registered as **scoped** (previously transient) so per-dispatch handler resolution binds to the calling scope; `ActualTypeOrFirstAssignableTypeMessageResolveStrategy` is a singleton. All registrations use `TryAdd`, so user overrides still win.
* New registration extension: `ForceMemoizedHandlers()` (opt-out of lifetime-aware resolution).

### Notes

* Behavioral change vs v1.1.0: scoped/transient-registered handlers (the default) are no longer silently memoized across scopes — they now behave as their registration declares. If you relied on the old implicit memoization for performance, either register those handlers as singletons or call `ForceMemoizedHandlers()`.
* With the ambient context disabled (the default), both the raw and public dispatch paths are faster than MediatR and allocate a fraction of its memory; enabling `EnableAmbientExecutionContext()` re-introduces the per-dispatch `AsyncLocal` cost.

## v1.1.0 – '2026-03-23'

## v0.0.13e - Republish of v0.0.12e - '2025-09-03'
- no changes
## v0.0.12e - EventHub - '2025-09-03'

## **New Features**

* **Centralized EventHub**: A thread-safe, global hub for Pre, Post, Handler, and Exception stage events.
* **Weak and Strong Subscriptions**: Subscribers can be registered as strong or weak references.

    * `IsAlive` property allows automatic cleanup of dead weak references.
    * Subscriptions implement `IDisposable`.
* **DI Integration**: EventHub now resolves via DI as a singleton using `EventHubAccessor`.
* **Thread-safe Publishing**: Publishing events is safe across multiple threads, with automatic cleanup of dead weak subscriptions.
* **Extensible Plugin Support**: Modules can subscribe to events without modifying core components.

**Keynote**

- This EventHub forms the foundation for future plugins and modules that do not need to be directly coupled with main modules.

- It enables developers to write their own n-party plugins, extending the system safely and independently.

---

**Side Note:**

* This EventHub system is **separate from the message mediation events** (pre/post/interceptor) used in command, query, and event pipelines.
* It provides a **general-purpose, centralized event mechanism** for modules and plugins to subscribe to runtime events without coupling to the core pipeline.
